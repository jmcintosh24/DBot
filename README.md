# DBot - Custom Discord Bot
DBot is a customized Discord bot that I have created for my friends and I to utilize in our discord servers. It contains several features that we thought would be convenient and useful to have. Whether it be automating tasks, or just pulling certain information from the web, this bot has made our lives just a little bit easier. The bot was created using the JDA (Java Discord API).
