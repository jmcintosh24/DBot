# DBot - Custom Discord Bot
DBot is a customized Discord bot that I have created for my friends and I to utilize in our discord servers. It contains several features that we thought would be convenient and useful to have. Whether it be automating tasks, or just pulling certain information from the web, this bot has made our lives just a little bit easier. The main focus of the bot is to interact with the Steam Web API, pulling information from it and displaying it in the discord chat. The bot was created using the JDA (Java Discord API).
